# Enhanced BC Ferries Architecture - Enterprise Maritime Telemetry

## 🎯 Advanced Features Integration

Based on the detailed AWS architecture patterns discussion, here are the key enhancements for the BC Ferries demonstration:

## 🏗️ Multi-Tier Architecture Enhancement

### **Hot Path (Real-time Processing)**
```
Device → IoT Core → TimeStream (Memory Store) → Grafana
                 → CloudWatch Alarms
                 → Device Defender Anomaly Detection
```

### **Cold Path (Analytics & Compliance)**
```
IoT Core → Kinesis Firehose → S3 (Iceberg Tables)
        → Glue Catalog → Athena → QuickSight
        → Lake Formation (Fine-grained Access)
```

### **Security Analytics Path**
```
CloudWatch Logs → Firehose → OpenSearch → Security Dashboards
Device Defender → SNS → Incident Response
```

## 🔐 Zero Trust Security Implementation

### **Identity & Authentication**
- **Devices**: X.509 certificates in TPM/Secure Elements
- **Humans**: SSO + phishing-resistant MFA (FIDO2/WebAuthn)  
- **Workloads**: Short-lived IAM roles, no static keys
- **Network**: VPC endpoints, private subnets, encrypted everywhere

### **Continuous Authorization**
- **IoT Core**: Custom authorizer for tenant-aware RBAC
- **Lake Formation**: Row/column-level access control with LF-tags
- **Device Defender**: Behavioral anomaly detection + automated quarantine

### **Data Protection**
- **Encryption**: KMS per-tenant keys for data at rest
- **Network**: TLS 1.3 everywhere, mTLS for device auth
- **Monitoring**: Complete audit trail via CloudTrail + OpenSearch

## 📊 Scalable Dashboard Strategy (10,000+ Topics)

### **Template-Driven Approach**
Instead of 10,000 individual panels:

1. **Fleet Overview** (1 dashboard)
   - Variables: tenant, timeRange
   - Heatmaps showing vessel health across fleet
   - KPI summaries and alert counts

2. **Vessel Dashboard** (1 template, N instances)  
   - Variables: vesselId, system, timeRange
   - System health overview for selected vessel
   - Drilldown links to system details

3. **System Detail** (1 template per system type)
   - Variables: vesselId, system, sensorGroup, timeRange
   - Detailed metrics for engine/power/nav/environmental
   - Individual sensor selection via dropdowns

4. **Sensor Drilldown** (1 template)
   - Variables: vesselId, system, sensorId, timeRange
   - Individual sensor time series + alerts
   - Historical analysis and anomaly detection

### **Multi-Measure Data Optimization**
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-11-15T14:30:00.000Z",
  "vesselId": "island-class-001",
  "system": "engine",
  "sensorGroup": "main-engine-1",
  "measures": {
    "rpm": 1850,
    "temperature": 87.5,
    "oil_pressure": 4.2,
    "fuel_flow": 145.8,
    "vibration_x": 0.02,
    "vibration_y": 0.01,
    "vibration_z": 0.03,
    "status": "normal",
    "alert_level": 0
  }
}
```

### **Automated Dashboard Generation**
```typescript
// Terraform/CDK pattern for dashboard provisioning
const createVesselDashboard = (vesselId: string) => {
  return {
    dashboard: {
      title: `Vessel ${vesselId} - Operations`,
      templating: {
        list: [
          {
            name: "system",
            query: `SELECT DISTINCT systemGroup FROM fleet_telemetry WHERE vesselId = '${vesselId}'`
          },
          {
            name: "timeRange",
            options: ["1h", "6h", "24h", "7d"]
          }
        ]
      },
      panels: generateSystemPanels(vesselId)
    }
  };
};
```
