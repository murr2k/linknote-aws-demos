# ops.linknote.com DNS Configuration

## Required CloudFlare DNS Record

To complete the dual dashboard setup, please create this DNS record in CloudFlare:

### DNS Record Details:
```
Type: A
Name: ops
Content: 66.241.125.115
Proxied: Yes (orange cloud icon)
TTL: Auto
```

### Alternative CNAME Record:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: ops
Content: 9lkoge2.bc-ferries-ops-dashboard.fly.dev
Proxied: Yes
TTL: Auto
```

## SSL Certificate Status

- **ops.linknote.com**: Certificate being generated by Let's Encrypt
- **ferry.linknote.com**: ✅ Certificate issued and working

## Verification Commands

After creating the DNS record, you can verify:

```bash
# Check DNS resolution
dig ops.linknote.com +short

# Test HTTPS connection (after SSL certificate is issued)
curl -I https://ops.linknote.com/health
```

## Expected Timeline

1. **DNS Creation**: Immediate (when you create the record)
2. **DNS Propagation**: 1-5 minutes
3. **SSL Certificate**: 1-2 minutes after DNS propagation
4. **Full Functionality**: ~5 minutes total

## Current Status

- **Ferry Control**: ✅ https://ferry.linknote.com (working)
- **Ops Dashboard**: ⏳ https://ops.linknote.com (pending DNS + SSL)

Once this DNS record is created, we'll have a fully functional dual dashboard system with WebSocket communication between ferry.linknote.com and ops.linknote.com!
