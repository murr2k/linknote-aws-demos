# BC Ferries Dual Dashboard - Current Status Summary

## ✅ Successfully Deployed (Ready for Demo)

### Ferry Control Dashboard 
- **Deployment**: ✅ bc-ferries-control-new.fly.dev (2 machines, healthy)
- **Features**: Interactive vessel controls, real-time WebSocket, emergency scenarios
- **Direct Access**: https://bc-ferries-control-new.fly.dev ✅ Working
- **Subdomain**: ferry.linknote.com (DNS configured, SSL/TLS issues)

### Operations Monitoring Dashboard
- **Deployment**: ✅ bc-ferries-ops-dashboard.fly.dev (2 machines, 1GB RAM, healthy)  
- **Features**: Maritime telemetry monitoring, real-time gauges, emergency alerts
- **Direct Access**: https://bc-ferries-ops-dashboard.fly.dev ✅ Working
- **Memory**: Fixed OOM issue by scaling to 1GB (+$5/month)

## 🔧 Current Issues & Solutions

### SSL/TLS Connection Issues
**Problem**: ferry.linknote.com SSL certificate not properly configured
- ferry.linknote.com → ECONNRESET (TLS handshake fails)
- ops dashboard cannot connect to ferry.linknote.com via WebSocket

**Immediate Workaround**: Both dashboards work independently via direct Fly.io URLs
**Solution Needed**: SSL certificate configuration or CloudFlare proxy settings

### DNS Status
- **ferry.linknote.com**: ✅ DNS resolves to 66.241.125.19 
- **ops.linknote.com**: ❌ Not configured yet (needs CloudFlare record → 66.241.125.115)

## 🎯 Ready for Demonstration

### What Works Now
1. **Ferry Control**: https://bc-ferries-control-new.fly.dev
   - Interactive vessel controls (engine RPM, battery, bilge level)
   - Emergency scenarios (fire alarm, heavy weather, low battery, docking)
   - Real-time WebSocket updates
   - REST API endpoints for vessel state overrides

2. **Operations Monitoring**: https://bc-ferries-ops-dashboard.fly.dev  
   - Professional maritime monitoring interface
   - Canvas-rendered engine gauges (RPM, temperature, fuel flow)
   - Real-time safety system monitoring
   - Historical data charts and analytics
   - Emergency alert system with acknowledgments

### Demonstration Flow
```
Presenter/Interviewer Actions:
1. Open ferry control: https://bc-ferries-control-new.fly.dev
2. Open ops monitoring: https://bc-ferries-ops-dashboard.fly.dev  
3. Adjust engine RPM slider → See real-time updates
4. Trigger fire alarm → Emergency response demonstration
5. Run heavy weather scenario → Power management demo
6. View historical data charts and telemetry trends
```

## 💰 Current Cost Analysis

### Monthly Costs (Within $75 Budget)
- **Ferry Control**: ~$7-12/month (Fly.io shared CPU + memory)
- **Ops Dashboard**: ~$12-17/month (1GB RAM for stability)
- **CloudFlare**: $0 (free tier)
- **Total**: ~$19-29/month ✅ Well under $75 budget

### Cost for 1-Week Demo
- **Estimated**: ~$5-7 total for demonstration week
- **Remaining Budget**: ~$68 available for AWS services and Grafana

## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Fix SSL/TLS for ferry.linknote.com** - Enable proper WebSocket communication
2. **Configure ops.linknote.com DNS** - Complete dual subdomain setup
3. **Test real-time dashboard communication** - Verify data flows between dashboards

### Medium Priority  
4. **HiveMQ Cloud MQTT setup** - Professional maritime telemetry broker
5. **AWS IoT Core integration** - Cloud-scale telemetry processing
6. **Grafana Cloud provisioning** - Professional monitoring workspace

### Low Priority
7. **SSL certificate management** - Proper certificates for custom domains
8. **Performance optimization** - Further memory and connection tuning
9. **Advanced monitoring** - Extended telemetry and analytics
