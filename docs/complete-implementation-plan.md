## üé≠ Interactive Demo Script

### **5-Minute Live Demonstration Flow**

#### **Setup & Introduction (30 seconds)**
```
"I'm going to show you a live BC Ferries Island Class vessel telemetry system.
On the left screen, I can control the vessel systems directly.
On the right screen, you see what BC Ferries operations center would monitor.
This is live data flowing through HiveMQ to AWS IoT Core to TimeStream to Grafana."
```

#### **Normal Operations Baseline (60 seconds)**
```
"Let's start with normal ferry operations crossing from Swartz Bay to Tsawwassen.
- Engine: 1,200 RPM steady cruise
- Battery: 85% state of charge in hybrid mode  
- Navigation: GPS tracking, AIS transponder active
- Safety: All systems green, fire detection normal
- This represents 200 of the eventual 10,000 sensors per vessel"
```

#### **Engine Performance Demo (90 seconds)**
```
"Now I'll simulate heavy weather requiring more power..."
[Action: Drag RPM slider from 1200 to 1800]

"Watch the right screen - you can see the RPM increase in real-time.
Notice the fuel flow automatically increases from 120 to 180 liters per hour.
Engine temperature is rising from 85¬∞C to 92¬∞C.
This data is flowing: Fly.io ‚Üí HiveMQ ‚Üí AWS ‚Üí Grafana in under 3 seconds."

"In November, this same pattern will work with the Damen Triton gateway."
```

#### **Emergency Scenario Demonstration (90 seconds)**
```
"Now let's simulate an emergency - engine room fire detection..."
[Action: Click "Trigger Fire Alarm" button]

"Watch the cascade effect:
- Fire alarm activates immediately
- Engine systems automatically reduce power
- Ventilation switches to fire suppression mode  
- Alert appears on the fleet monitoring dashboard
- In production, this would notify BC Ferries dispatch center"

[Action: Click "Acknowledge Alarm" to reset]

"System recovery is just as important as detection."
```

#### **Power System Innovation (60 seconds)**
```
"BC Ferries' Island Class vessels are hybrid-electric. Let me show the power management..."
[Action: Drag battery SOC from 85% to 25%]

"Low battery triggers automatic mode switching."
[Action: Click "Switch to Diesel Mode"]

"Generator starts, battery begins charging, electric motors switch to diesel backup.
This optimization can save 15-20% in fuel costs across the fleet."
```

#### **Scalability & Integration Wrap-up (30 seconds)**
```
"This demonstration shows 200 sensors on 1 vessel for 8 days.
The architecture scales to:
- 10,000 sensors per vessel  
- 50+ vessels in the BC Ferries fleet
- Real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance
- Ready for November deployment with Damen Triton integration"
```
