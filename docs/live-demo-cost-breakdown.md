## ðŸ”§ Cost Optimization Options

### **Option 1: Budget Minimal ($15-25)**
```
Replace HiveMQ Cloud with local Docker:
- Run HiveMQ CE locally during demo
- Use ngrok/CloudFlare tunnel for access
- AWS costs remain the same: $139.38
- No external service costs
- Total: ~$139.38

Risk: Local setup complexity, potential connectivity issues
```

### **Option 2: Development Scale ($50-75)**
```
Reduce message frequency:
- 200 sensors at 1 message/minute instead of 1/second
- Messages: 200 Ã— 60 min/day Ã— 7 days = 84,000 total
- IoT Core cost drops to ~$0.10
- Keep HiveMQ Cloud for reliability: $49
- Total: ~$50
```

### **Option 3: Pre-recorded Data ($25-35)**
```
Use batch data upload instead of real-time:
- Upload historical data to TimeStream
- Build dashboards on static data
- No continuous MQTT messaging
- Only pay for TimeStream storage/queries
- Total: ~$25-35
```

## ðŸ’¡ Demo Script Outline

### **5-Minute Live Demo**
1. **Fleet Overview** (30 sec): Show vessel on fleet map
2. **Engine Systems** (60 sec): Real-time RPM, temperature, fuel flow
3. **Power Systems** (60 sec): Battery SOC, hybrid mode switching
4. **Navigation** (45 sec): GPS track, AIS status, environmental sensors
5. **Safety Monitoring** (45 sec): Fire detection, bilge levels, alerts
6. **Historical Analysis** (60 sec): Trend analysis, predictive insights

### **Key Talking Points**
- "This is live telemetry from our Island Class simulator"
- "HiveMQ broker handling 200 sensors with mTLS security"  
- "AWS TimeStream storing 10,000 data points per hour"
- "Grafana dashboards updating every 5 seconds"
- "Ready to scale to full 10,000 sensor deployment"

## âœ… Recommendation: Invest $75

For the BC Ferries interview opportunity, **$75 is a minimal investment** that provides:
- **Maximum Impact**: Live demonstration capability
- **Professional Credibility**: Production-grade architecture  
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proves technical capability beyond promises
- **Competitive Advantage**: Most candidates won't have live demos
- **ROI Potential**: 1,300x return if contract is secured

**Bottom Line**: The cost of a nice dinner out could secure a $100K+ maritime telemetry contract.
